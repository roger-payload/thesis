Hadoop Configuration Using Evolutionary Computing

Apache Hadoop provides more than hundreds of default parameter configuration
settings common for all type of clusters and applications. Apache Hadoop
Yarn provides functionality that users can customize parameter configuration
settings as per their needs through xml file setting as well as in writing program
coding for performance tuning of resources likes CPU, I/O, Memory, and Network.
Customizing parameter configuration is a black art which requires good
knowledge of each parameter and what is the impact when we change its default
values because all parameters are interconnected and affect each others performance.
Proper parameter configuration can improve and tune performance as
well as misparameter configuration setting can decrease performance of the system.
In this project, we will investigate using Evolutionary Computing (genetic
algorithms) in order to evolve Hadoop configuration for the aim of maximizing
performance.
