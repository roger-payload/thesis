		\section{Target group}
		This thesis covers the deep technical aspects of big data analysis and genetic algorithms. All techniques used will be explained in detail, but it is advised to have a certain degree of technical insight before reading.
		\section{Area of research}
		Hadoop and MapReduce are already well established technologies employed in countless applications around the world. I propose a new method of implementing Hadoop clusters, with an out-of-the-box approach, meaning that this thesis purely covers the implementation aspect.
		\section{Personal motivation}
		The subject for this master thesis is a natural continuation of my previous work \emph{Hadoop MapReduce Scheduling Paradigms}, published in 2017, in the 2nd IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis (ISSSBDA 2017). Back then the topic was haphazardly picked from a list of eligible ones, but the more I read into it - the more I understood the incredible use cases for Hadoop within the massive industries that are driving forces for our technological advancements. It felt like an awakening when I realized the potential implications of future IoT, advanced data analysis and business intelligence.
